# My First blog

## Description

This blog page was created with the intentions of showcasing thoughts and experiences.
This personal blog was created with the purpose of learning to apply what I have learned about Javascript. It is very challenging in my opinion and creating this personal blog has helped me tremendously learn how to apply what I have learned from scratch. 
Buliding this personal blog has shown me how important Javascript is for all kinds of webpages and how it links it all together. 
I have learn a lot about what Javascipt does and how it works. I have much more to learn.
